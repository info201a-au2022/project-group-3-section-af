## Abstract

Our main focus for this project is to identify any significant patterns regarding
police violence, criminal activity, racial equity, and other factors influencing these activities
in the United States. In analyzing these patterns, we will inspect multiple datasets
that involves the characteristics of the many locations in which these violent events
took place. With the rising political conversations regarding the police and the protection
of the residents, we find it important to search for any correlations in these events
for people to generate a more informed opinion surrounding the controversy.

#### Keywords
* Police activity
* Racial equity
* City budgets
* Crimes/Arrests/Casualties by state

## Introduction
For our project, we plan on visualizing and analyzing data in search of any prominent
patterns in order to educate people on the controversial topic of police violence and its
correlation of racial equity. The datasets that we are using involves a collection of casualties
resulting from police response. This includes both the deaths of the victims and the police,
along with demographic information such as age, race, gender, and the causes of death. Other data
is presented in our study, such as the number of protests present from the outcome of these events,
the amount of funding allocated for the police departments, the representation of the government parties,
along with the quality of education and sources of housing present in each state. With all of this data,
we hope to seek out any concerning patterns involving the mistreatment of violent activity
and allow any citizens and activists to address these concerns with supported claims to fight
for a more protected, united, responsible country.

## Research Questions

 1. **What is the distribution of police and criminal activity within the United States?**
  * Violence could possibly be presented unequally in the country, due to the uneven human population
between each states, and the cities within those states. Other factors that can influence
the violence rate can arise from the distribution of the population present, which can affect
the overall societal climate. It is important to acknowledge the equality of the issue
around the whole country, and dive deeper in figuring out what factors might influence the
equality/inequality of the issue.

2. **What does the demographic data tell us about the casualty patterns in each state?**
  * One of the main addresses to the conversation of police activity is the assumption
  of bias in the outcome of each violent situation. Inspecting the demographic patterns of the
  victims, along with the demographic statistics of the whole state can help in identifying
  whether or not the issue of racial equity is present in each associated area, or if the cases
  are bordering the coincidental appearance. This allows us to search deeper into each case attentively.


3. **How does the status of the state's societal values align with the challenges present?**
  * Most irregular events do not occur by one effect, but rather multiple factors that create a unified
  problem. Some of these factors arise from the living conditions that the community faces. This includes
  the quality of education; the representation of people in schools and how the education system is maintained,
  and the control of neighborhoods; the safety from criminal activity and availability in housing
  for families to reside without fear and provide for their community without interruption. Political beliefs
  also hold some value in the effectiveness in this scenario; such as the acceptance of gun control.
  Understanding how these values impact the problem can lead us to finding other methods in
  resolving the problem, and possibly other problems related to these values.

## Expected Implications

With the discoveries found in the datasets, we expect concerned citizens to inform their
peers in pressing the government to address the prolonging issues in our country. More specifically,
we hope to see activists provide more detailed evidence of the issue in making their claims more
assertive. We also expect to see any political figures to identify the causes/correlations
of the problem, and brainstorm solutions that pertains to their area of control. We hope for
the bountiful communities to understand how the problem affects their daily lives, and come to
a unified agreement in changing their society no matter their division of ideas. We also
hope to encourage future data scientists to assist in tracking the current and future situation,
so that we can review our progress and change accordingly to the data given.
