# The Dataset

Our dataset provides police-related violence and racial equity in the United States. Since Law enforcement agencies and government provide insufficient numbers of lives killed by police during arrest, the presence of documents about police killings that are supplied by the USA National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), FBI, and all data from the agencies and governments are not well-organized. Therefore figuring out the relationship between police violence and race through statistics from these resources is still difficult. Our dataset includes categorized data on police shootings, descriptive statistics for citizen fatalities involving police, and police officer deaths suffered in the line of duty. This can provide not only comprehensive accounting of people killed by police but also provides the relationship between police violence and racial equity. For example, Our data for citizens fatally shot by police provides names, dates, manner of death, whether the person was armed, age, race, city, state, signs of mental illness, threat level and the existence of body cam, and the location. Through the details of the citizens killed by the police, we can observe the legitimacy of the shooting by the identification of the victim. In regards to our dataset, since Jan. 1, 2015, the post of Fatal Force is regularly updated as fatal shootings are reported, and our dataset is updated as of Aug 2020.
