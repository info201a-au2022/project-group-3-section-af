# Problem Domain
Our project focuses on the links between police brutality and racial violence, along with the inequity at play there. This project aims to use objective data to try and see the links between the different issues and situations at play

## Human Values
Datasets involving human lives often create a dilemma, as they can be seen as reducing the life of a human to a simple number. Our project strives to utilize this data to instead inform and try and find the coorelations between the inequities in the United States and the police state. This data can be useful to try and break down these issues and begin to tackle them head on. The website listed below tracks human lives taken by police, police lives taken, and other important data that can be used to visualize better the human impacts at play.

## Direct & Inderect Stakeholders
The direct stakeholders for our data would be the people utilizing them, whether that be activists, politicians or government officials. These people have the capacity to enact change through the data provided and directly make a change. Indirect stakeholders here would be families of vicitms, police or anyone else involved within the datasets. More will be covered about this in the next section, but this website highlights an activist group of people who had a family member killed by the police: [United 4 Justice Group](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2015/05/meet-families-affected-police-violence-organizing-stop-killing/)

## Harms & Benefit
If this data were to be utilized by direct stakeholders that are looking to create change and progress, it could lead to great results regarding limiting police brutality. However, data like this always has a cost, as it minimizes human suffering and deaths to statistics, but depending on the stakeholder this could be good or bad. Some unintended consequences could be, in areas with less police brutality, an argument could be made that there isn't a pandemic of police violence and racial inequity in the United States. This Stanford page offers multiple resoruces that shows the benefits that could be made utlizing similar data to what we're using.

# Acknowledgments
We would like to use this short section as a quick shout out to John M., who created the data sets we are utilizing for our assignment. His data will help us create a clear and concise project that we hope turns out very well.
