## Abstract

Our main focus for this project is to identify any significant patterns regarding police violence, criminal activity, racial equity, and other factors influencing these activities in the United States. In analyzing these patterns, we will inspect multiple datasets that involves the characteristics of the many locations in which these violent events took place. With the rising political conversations regarding the police and the protection of the residents, we find it important to search for any correlations in these events for people to generate a more informed opinion surrounding the controversy.

Keywords

* Police activity
* Racial equity
* City budgets
* Crimes/Arrests/Casualties by state

## Introduction

For our project, we plan on visualizing and analyzing data in search of any prominent patterns in order to educate people on the controversial topic of police violence and its correlation of racial equity. The datasets that we are using involves a collection of casualties resulting from police response. This includes both the deaths of the victims and the police, along with demographic information such as age, race, gender, and the causes of death. Other data is presented in our study, such as the number of protests present from the outcome of these events, the amount of funding allocated for the police departments, the representation of the government parties, along with the quality of education and sources of housing present in each state. With all of this data, we hope to seek out any concerning patterns involving the mistreatment of violent activity and allow any citizens and activists to address these concerns with supported claims to fight for a more protected, united, responsible country.

## Problem Domain

Our project focuses on the links between police brutality and racial violence, along with the inequity at play there. This project aims to use objective data to try and see the links between the different issues and situations at play.

* Human Values

Datasets involving human lives often create a dilemma, as they can be seen as reducing the life of a human to a simple number. Our project strives to utilize this data to instead inform and try and find the correlations between the inequities in the United States and the police state. This data can be useful to try and break down these issues and begin to tackle them head on. The website listed below tracks human lives taken by police, police lives taken, and other important data that can be used to visualize better the human impacts at play. Police Violence Mapped

* Direct & Indirect Stakeholders

The direct stakeholders for our data would be the people utilizing them, whether that be activists, politicians or government officials. These people have the capacity to enact change through the data provided and directly make a change. Indirect stakeholders here would be families of victims, police or anyone else involved within the datasets. More will be covered about this in the next section, but this website highlights an activist group of people who had a family member killed by the police: United 4 Justice Group

* Harms & Benefit

If this data were to be utilized by direct stakeholders that are looking to create change and progress, it could lead to great results regarding limiting police brutality. However, data like this always has a cost, as it minimizes human suffering and deaths to statistics, but depending on the stakeholder this could be good or bad. Some unintended consequences could be, in areas with less police brutality, an argument could be made that there isn't a pandemic of police violence and racial inequity in the United States. This Stanford page offers multiple resources that shows the benefits that could be made utilizing similar data to what we're using. Stanford Cite

## Research Questions

1. What is the distribution of police and criminal activity within the United States?

Violence could possibly be presented unequally in the country, due to the uneven human population between each states, and the cities within those states. Other factors that can influence the violence rate can arise from the distribution of the population present, which can affect the overall societal climate. It is important to acknowledge the equality of the issue around the whole country, and dive deeper in figuring out what factors might influence the equality/inequality of the issue.

2. What does the demographic data tell us about the casualty patterns in each state?

One of the main addresses to the conversation of police activity is the assumption of bias in the outcome of each violent situation. Inspecting the demographic patterns of the victims, along with the demographic statistics of the whole state can help in identifying whether or not the issue of racial equity is present in each associated area, or if the cases are bordering the coincidental appearance. This allows us to search deeper into each case attentively.

3. How does the status of the state's societal values align with the challenges present?

Most irregular events do not occur by one effect, but rather multiple factors that create a unified problem. Some of these factors arise from the living conditions that the community faces. This includes the quality of education; the representation of people in schools and how the education system is maintained, and the control of neighborhoods; the safety from criminal activity and availability in housing for families to reside without fear and provide for their community without interruption. Political beliefs also hold some value in the effectiveness in this scenario; such as the acceptance of gun control. Understanding how these values impact the problem can lead us to finding other methods in resolving the problem, and possibly other problems related to these values.

## The Dataset

Our dataset provides police-related violence and racial equity in the United States. The Law enforcement agencies and government provide insufficient numbers of lives killed by police during arrest, therefore the presence of documents about police killings that are supplied by the USA National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), FBI, and from other institutions are not well-organized. Due to this issue, figuring out the patterns between police violence and race through statistics from these resources is still difficult. Our dataset includes categorized data on police shootings, descriptive statistics for citizen fatalities involving police, and police officer deaths suffered in the line of duty. This can provide not only comprehensive accounting of people killed by police but also provides the relationship between police violence and racial equity. For example, Our data for citizens fatally shot by police provides names, dates, manner of death, whether the person was armed, age, race, city, state, signs of mental illness, threat level and the existence of body cam, and the location. Through the details of the citizens killed by the police, we can observe the patterns of people who killed by police. The pattern can be arrangd by age, race or locations. In regards to our dataset, since Jan. 1, 2015, the post of Fatal Force is regularly updated as fatal shootings are reported, and our dataset is updated as of Aug 2020.

By collecting this data, our dataset can report the details of citizens killed by the police. Moreover, through this dataset, we can observe police-related violence and racial equity more in-depth with the identification of police officers and citizens. Our data will benefitical for the public, organizations, and government by providing them an insight into the pattern of police violence and racial equity.

## Expected Implications

With the discoveries found in the datasets, we expect concerned citizens to inform their peers in pressing the government to address the prolonging issues in our country. More specifically, we hope to see activists provide more detailed evidence of the issue in making their claims more assertive. We also expect to see any political figures to identify the causes/correlations of the problem, and brainstorm solutions that pertains to their area of control. We hope for the bountiful communities to understand how the problem affects their daily lives, and come to a unified agreement in changing their society no matter their division of ideas. We also hope to encourage future data scientists to assist in tracking the current and future situation, so that we can review our progress and change accordingly to the data given.
